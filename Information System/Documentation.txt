VILLAGE INFORMATION

--For the village information section, we'll create a form to add new villages and a table to display existing village information
--Each row in the table now has an "Edit" and "Delete" button. Clicking the "Edit" button allows you to edit the village name and
population inline. Clicking the "Delete" button prompts a confirmation dialog before deleting the village from the table.

REPORTS
--The generatePopulationReport function calculates the total population, the generateInfrastructureReport function summarizes the
types of infrastructure, and the generateResidentsReport function finds the oldest resident.
The reports are then displayed in the reportResult div based on the selected report type.
